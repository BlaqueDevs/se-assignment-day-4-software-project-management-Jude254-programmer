# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
Timely delivery is crucial so as to avoid extended budget on the project, lost market opportunities and stakeholders being dissatified.
How to ensure deadlines are  met:
- Break the project into small manageable tasks with realistic timelines
- Use project management tools like Jira to keep track and progress of the project
- Conduct regular meetings with team members to adress burning issues early
- Implement Agile methodology in your project for iterative approach
- Allocate resources effectively to avoid scope creep
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Cost control ensures project stays within budget avoid financial strain in the organisation leading to profitability.
Strategies to use:
- Creating a well defined budget and tracking actual expenses against it.
- Implement a formal process for handling scope changes to avoid uncontrolled spending.
- Monitor expenses regularly and compare them against the budget.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
- Agile:
 - Flexibility - Agile is more flexible, focusing on small, rapid cycles and of which follows iterative approach.
 - Advantages - Fast delivery to where it delivers working increments of the product early and often.
           - Its flexible to where it adapts to changes quickly.
 - Disadvantages - Its challenging to manage scope creep and budget due to its adaptive nature.
              - Requires more of customer involvement.
- Waterfall:
  - Structured- like a linear flow- one step finishes before the next steps starts.
  - Advantages - Has a clear structure and documented steps.
           - Easier to estimate timelines and costs upfront.
  - Disadvantages - Inflexible to changes once the project kicks off.
              - Testing happens later in the process leading to risks in major failures.
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
- Agile is better for projects where requirements evolve, such as mobile apps, and AI-powered systems. Example: Developing a fintech app where user feedback is crucial.
- Waterfall is better for large-scale projects i.e Where extensive planning and documentation are required e.g., building an airport management system.
  
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
 The methods are; automated testing, unit testing, integration testing, continous integration and code reviews
- Importance:
- Maintaining high standards prevents costly bugs and also improves user satisfaction and experience.
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
 Defining the project scope prevents scope creep, which can derail timelines and budgets.
- Work Breakdown Structure(WBS) is  hierarchical breakdown of the project into smaller, manageable tasks and is useful since it make large projects easier to manage by assigning clear responsibilities and timelines.
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
A detailed schedule improves task tracking, resource allocation, and risk management.
- Gantt charts displays tasks, durations, and dependencies in an easy-to-understand format.
  
## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
My Second-Hand Marketplace for Students solves key problems students face when buying and selling used items:

- No Centralized Platform – Students rely on word-of-mouth and social media, making transactions unorganized.
- High Costs – Many can’t afford new items, so a second-hand marketplace offers affordable alternatives.
- Trust Issues – Scams and low-quality purchases are common; user verification ensures safer transactions.
- Inefficient Communication – In-app chat and scheduling simplify buyer-seller interactions.
- Environmental Waste – Encourages reuse, reducing waste from discarded items.
This platform creates a secure, affordable, and sustainable marketplace for students.

## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
A clear problem statement ensures that development efforts address real user needs rather than assumptions, reducing wasted effort and improving user adoption.
## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
A smart housing recommendation platform that helps students find affordable and safe off-campus accommodation based on their preferences.
## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
- Student-Only Marketplace – Verified student accounts ensure a trusted community.
- In-App Chat & Scheduling – Simplifies buyer-seller communication and meetups.
- Smart Search & Filters – Quick item discovery by category, price, or location.
- Secure Transactions – User ratings and verification reduce scams.
- Sustainability Focus – Promotes reuse, reducing waste on campus.
## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
- Large Student Population – Universities have thousands of students, creating a steady demand for affordable second-hand goods.
- Rising Digital Adoption – More students prefer online platforms for convenience, increasing potential users.
- Growing Second-Hand Economy – The global resale market is expanding, with students being a key demographic.
## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your software’s positioning and development?
- Rise of Digital Marketplaces → Optimize for mobile-first experience to match student preferences.
- Growing Second-Hand Economy → Focus on affordability and sustainability to attract budget-conscious students.
- Trust & Security Concerns → Implement user verification and ratings to build credibility.
